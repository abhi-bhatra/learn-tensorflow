<h1>Chapter 1: Practise Lab</h1>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

In this Lab you'll try to build a neural network that predicts the profit earned by a salesman on doing particular sales according to a simple formula.

So, imagine if Sales Pricing was as easy as on each sale, it cost Salesman 50 INR for petrol to reach to destination, it cost 100 INR for advertisement of each sale and finally, he earns 200 INR on a sale.

How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 10 sale as profit close to 1850 INR etc.

Example: if Salesman done 1 sale, then the profit he earns is `200 INR - 100 INR(on Advertisement) - 50 INR(on Petrol) = 50 INR,  on 2 sales he earns 400 INR - 100 INR - 50 INR = 250 INR` and so on..!

 <h3>Give it a try</h3>
 
 Use `Solution.ipynb`, after giving it a try!!! This will enhance learn at your own pace and helps in better learning.
 Hint: Your network might work better if you scale the sale profit down. You don't have to give the answer 250...it might be better to create something that predicts the number 2.5, and then your answer is in the 'hundreds' etc.
